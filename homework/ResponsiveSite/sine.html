      The Sine waveform is characterized by a smooth cycle of oscillation, typically used in more mellow-sounding contexts. Sine waves are one of the most fundamental waveforms in audio, as it features no upper harmonics and represents only one frequency.
      Sine waves do not typically cut through a mix, so music producers will often use them at much lower frequencies, such as a bass synthesizer to add to the low end, but avoid making the mix sound too harsh. Sine waves are also frequently combined with sawtooth and square waves to balance out the "pointyness" of the other waves. </p>
