      The Sawtooth waveform is a waveform that features a ramp up to the highest point in the amplitude, then a 180 degree drop at the end of the cycle. This creates a right triangle shaped wave. Multiple waves of this are what give the sawtooth wave its name. Sawtooth waves are the harshest and pointiest fundamental wave used in sound synthesis. Because of this, sawtooth waves are rarely ever used on their own due to their very directed sound. They are typically combined with either a square or sine wave to create a lead voice. </p>
