        In the general world of sound synthesis and sound design, there are many different types of waveforms that sound designers have at their disposal&mdash;certain waveforms can even be created by users through wavetable synthesis. Ultimately, there is an incredible pallet of choice. In subtractive synthesis, one of the simplest and most fundamental forms of sound synthesis, sound starts as one of three fundamental waveforms that are then mixed, matched, and added to eachother to create something new. These three fundamental waveforms are the Sine wave, the Square wave, and the Sawtooth wave.
