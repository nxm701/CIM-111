      The Square waveform is the result of many sine waves of different frequencies (specifically the overtone series) stacked on top of eachother. This creates an oscillation that is the exact opposite of a sine wave in terms of amplitude shape. This wave is typically percieved as louder, and with a more present tone. Square waves are typically used in lead instruments, such as a lead synthesizer or an accent, due to their ability to strongly function on their own. </p>
